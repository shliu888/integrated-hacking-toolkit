Getting started:

1. Run install-python.sh to install Python if it's not already installed
2. Run install-pip.sh to install Pip if it's not already installed
3. Finally, run install.sh to finalize installation.
4. Run the toolkit with the command "hackingtoolkit"

Note: This tool is currently designed for Kali Linux, a Debian-based Linux distribution intended for ethical hacking. In order to run install-python.sh and install-pip.sh, you must have a Debian-based distribution. Otherwise, you must install necessary dependencies separately.
