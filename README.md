Getting started:

1. Run install-python.sh to install Python if it's not already installed
2. Run install-pip.sh to install Pip if it's not already installed
3. Run install-dependencies.sh to install necessary tools and dependencies (required for most users, but check the code to see if you can skip some steps)
4. Finally, run install.sh with sudo privileges to finalize installation.
5. Run the toolkit with the command "hackingtoolkit"

𝐍𝐨𝐭𝐞: This tool is currently designed for Kali Linux, a Linux distribution built for penetration testing. In order to run install-python.sh, install-dependencies.sh and install-pip.sh, you must have Debian or a Debian-based distribution (like Ubuntu and Kali Linux). Otherwise, you must install necessary dependencies separately.
