Getting started:

1. Run install-python.sh to install Python if it's not already installed
2. Run install-pip.sh to install Pip if it's not already installed
3. Run install-tools.sh to install necessary tools (not needed for Kali Linux)
4. Finally, run install.sh with sudo privileges to finalize installation.
5. Run the toolkit with the command "hackingtoolkit"

𝐍𝐨𝐭𝐞: This tool is currently designed for Kali Linux, a Linux distribution built for penetration testing. In order to run install-python.sh, install-tools.sh and install-pip.sh, you must have Debian or a Debian-based distribution (like Ubuntu and Kali Linux). Otherwise, you must install necessary dependencies separately.
