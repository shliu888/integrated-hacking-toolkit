Getting started:

Tip: Switch to root before downloading this repository to run everything with root privileges

1. Run install-python.sh to install Python if it's not already installed
2. Run install-pip.sh to install Pip if it's not already installed
3. Run install-dependencies.sh to install necessary dependencies (required for most users)
4. Run install-tools.sh to install necessary tools (Kali Linux users should do this step too, as there are external tools that aren't included with Kali Linux)
5. Finally, run install.sh with sudo privileges to finalize installation.
6. Run the toolkit with the command "hackingtoolkit" 

𝗡𝗼𝘁𝗲: This tool is currently designed for Kali Linux, a Linux distribution built for penetration testing. In order to run install-python.sh, install-dependencies.sh and install-pip.sh, you must have Debian or a Debian-based distribution (like Ubuntu and Kali Linux). Otherwise, you must install necessary dependencies separately.
