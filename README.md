Getting started:

Tip: Switch to root before downloading this repository to run everything with root privileges automatically

1. Run "sudo ./install-pip.sh" if pip3 is not already installed (it should be on Kali Linux)    
2. Run "pip3 install -r requirements.txt"   
3. Run "sudo ./install.sh" to finalize installation   
4. Run the tool with the command "hackingtoolkit"!   

**Note**: This tool is currently designed for Kali Linux, a Linux distribution built for penetration testing. In order to run install-python.sh, install-dependencies.sh and install-pip.sh, you must have Debian or a Debian-based distribution (like Ubuntu and Kali Linux). Otherwise, you must install necessary dependencies separately.
